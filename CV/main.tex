I am excited to apply for the position of research engineer at the Montery Bay Aquarium Research Institute. I am highly motivated to work on underwater systems as well as machine learning systems, especially when they have impact on the environment. 

During my role as student researcher I have worked on adaptive sampling for underwater autonomus vehicles. I coauthored a paper which was published in IEEE AUV 2018 on using adaptive sampling techniques to plan around hazardous areas. During that time I spoke with many MBARI employees who were also presenting. I am excited for the work MBARI is doing in field with underwater vision and filtration sampling. 

I have also worked on vision based projects during an internship at MITRE in San Diego. I helped build a system to identify specific aircraft from aerial imagery using deep learning techniques. This was a technical challenge because there was very little known imagery of these aircraft as well as an organizational challenge because five different teams were working on different aspects of the project.
